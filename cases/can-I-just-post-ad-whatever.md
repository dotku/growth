Marketing is tricky, the wrong way to promote your product could lead serious Public Relationship cause.
Recently the SPY 500 company JD was involed marketing issue. JD invited a femilist artist for their
marketing repersentive lead them into public relationship problem. The male clients againist the 
feamilist artist, and request for membership refund. While JD was post article to show the apology,
it raised anger reaction from their female customers.

While JD did terriable marketing action, on contract, X fight for their public speech rights,
the sponsors went off from the platform for a temporary, but still come back due to the strong social 
impact and meaning of free speech belive.

So marketing is actually a tool, the more important is understanding the social need, the market
needs, by that way, we could deliver a better marketing result.
